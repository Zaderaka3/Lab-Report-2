/*
* Goal: This program creates an RGB "chasing" light effect using four LEDs in sequence.
*       Each LED lights up one after the other, creating a moving light pattern.
* Main Theme: Digital output control using multiple LEDs, with delays to create the chasing effect.
*             Each LED is controlled individually to simulate the light chase.
